<h1><style="float:right; margin-right:-100px">here I sincerely want to tell more about my feelings. I'll start with the fact that I'm monogamous and if I fall in love, then it's strong and for a long time (forever hehe) and I won't see anyone but the object of my adoration. Nagisa is the sweetest, kindest, funniest, interesting, comfortable, generous, handsome, the best person for me. I don't need anyone but him. I truly love him with all my heart and I want to be with him forever and in all future lives, forever forever forever. I want to marry him and create a family with children and cats ^_^ I want to give him all my love and care, which I do and will do for the rest of my life. this man saved me from suicide and I am very grateful to him. This man gave me the light in my life and gave me the kind of love that my own parents did not give me. This man is an example of a healthy partner in a healthy relationship, and I am very happy that I found him. this is my greatest luck and pride in life, and most importantly, my greatest love! Nagisa, I love you more than my life, be with me forever!</h1>
