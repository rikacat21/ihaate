<h1 class = "h1" style="float:center-right;" >This is the story of our acquaintance!!! We met on May 28, 2024, at 5:29 Moscow time or at 11:29 Tokyo time. It was on a dating site and chatting with foreign people. Coincidentally, I got bored at night and came across his profile. The name "Nagisa" is my favorite name in the world, so I couldn't waste the chance to write to a person with that name. Fortunately, he replied 9 minutes later, we exchanged usernames in a Telegram and continued to communicate. I fell in love with him at first sight, so I wrote to him from the very beginning in order to have a romantic relationship. It so happened that he also fell in love with me and now we are lovers, and at the time of the creation of the site (08/19/24) we have been together for 2 months and 22 days.  To be honest, I never thought that fate would bring me together with such a wonderful person. There are a lot of things that indicate that this is a real fate. It's banal that I'm a Russian who is interested in Japan, and he is a Japanese who is interested in Russia. We met once in real life. It was the best time of my whole life. I have never received so much love and care from anyone as from Nagisa. I've never had as much fun with anyone as I have with him. And I have never cried so much from happiness and love as with him.</h1>
